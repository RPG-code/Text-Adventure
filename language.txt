Language parser improvements
============================

1. Single words:
- make a list of them. 
- any single word that is not on the list "I don't understand that command"

2. Two words: Verb-Noun
- check to see if verb is valid
- check to see if noun goes with that verb.
- if not, then "How do you ___ that"? (how do you climb that?" "There is no NOUN here")
- now we have to run the correct method. Could use lambda? but don't know how, so large switch:

switch
verb, noun:
	method(word2)

- open paper
- read paper
- walk north
- pull lever
- kick leaves
- use ____

3. Three words.
Unusual. One seems to be a direction, one seems to be a noun in the location
- climb up tree [ climb up --> climb]  
- climb down tree
- pull lever down
- pick up rock [ pick up --> take]
- reach into water

4. Four words: verb noun preposition noun
- first make sure both nouns are items that are present

examples:
- take emerald from chest
- put knife into chest
- put hand in water
- give A to B
- attack troll with sword [wield sword, attack troll]
- hit/smash rock with hammer
- use hammer on door
- use hammer to break rock [remove word "to"] (if there are 5 words and one is "to")
