# Text-Adventure

This is a copy of my text adventure game, to show you how I've done things.

:white_check_mark: Things that work well: **movement, items, and inventory**

:eight_spoked_asterisk: Things that are okay but could be better: **containers, having specific methods for items**

:negative_squared_cross_mark: Things that are buggy: **doors that can be locked, some of the parsing still needs improvement.**
